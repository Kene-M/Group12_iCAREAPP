# Group12_iCAREAPP
iCARE is a web application built using the ASP.NET MVC Framework, designed for managing healthcare tasks, documents, patient and treatment records efficiently.

## Project Details
**Created by:** Kene, Isaiah, Sydney, Cooper.

**Name of Database:** Group12_iCAREDB

### Description
The iCARE application provides a user-friendly interface for managing patients, assigning healthcare workers, and handling document storage. This tool is intended to streamline administrative tasks and improve the efficiency of healthcare workflows.

* **Patient Record Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete patient records, with fields for essential information such as height, weight, date of birth, and assigned bed ID.
* **Worker Assignments**: Assign doctors and nurses to patients, with limits enforced (e.g., only one doctor and up to three nurses per patient).
* **Document Handling**: Store and view patient-related documents, with support for inline display of images and PDFs.
* **Minimal Role-Based Access Control**: Different levels of access and views have been assigned to doctors, nurses, and administrators to maintain data security and integrity.
